Internship Report

1. Introduction

This report provides an overview of my internship experience at NullClass, where I worked on machine learning tasks related to emotion detection and biometric-based attendance systems. The internship duration was from January 21, 2025, to February 21, 2025.

2. Background

The internship focused on deep learning and machine learning applications in real-world scenarios, particularly in emotion detection using CNNs and voice recognition models. My primary responsibilities included training models, implementing algorithms, and analyzing their performance.

3. Learning Objectives

Gain hands-on experience with CNN-based emotion detection.

Understand and implement biometric-based attendance systems.

Develop voice-based emotion recognition models.

Improve knowledge of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

4. Activities and Tasks

Task 1: Visualizing Activation Maps

Implemented visualization of CNN activation maps to interpret the decision-making process of the network.

Used a pre-trained model for generating heatmaps of image regions activating different CNN layers.

Evaluation was done using Matplotlib and OpenCV.

Task 2: Attendance System Model

Developed a machine learning model to detect and recognize students' faces in real time.

Integrated an emotion detection module to analyze students' emotions.

Stored attendance records in an Excel/CSV file with timestamps.

Limited detection to a fixed timeframe (9:30 AM - 10:00 AM).

Task 3: Emotion Detection through Voice

Trained an emotion recognition model using voice recordings.

Implemented gender-based filtering, ensuring only female voices were analyzed.

Developed a GUI for voice input and emotion classification.

Processed both recorded and uploaded audio samples.
